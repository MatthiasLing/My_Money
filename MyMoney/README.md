# My_Money

Contributor: MatthiasLing

# Functionality

An app to track your expenses, deposits, and withdrawals.  Enabled searching and budget-setting capabilities

Settings and entries are saved via Shared Preferences and SQLite database respectively, and queries are run using SQL commands.

# Intention and Usage

My Money in its current state has only been tested for the iPhone 8 and is intended for private use (hence the local password and name).  To customize simply change these fields in the home_screen.dart file.
